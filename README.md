## Planning and Development

This project is born out of the Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly Boston (formerly the WDI, Web Development Immersive) and is my first foray into web development.

#### My Process and Problem Solving Strategy
1.Consider the essential parts of the game, essentially down to bare bones, and focus on getting the functionality of that working first. 
2. Begin sketching out the wireframes for the initial idea of UX design.
3. Create user stories (*See example user stories below*)
4. I started by getting an absolute minimal game board set up for visual purposes.
4. I decided to set up the user authentication process first, I then followed this up by setting the game logic and then, the visual aspects of the game.
5. Continually kept on track with my user stories to ensure that all recognized user features were being implemented effectively.
6. Test, troubleshoot, debug, refactor, and confirm working deployment.

#### User stories
+ As a user, I want be able to sign in to my account.
+ As a user, I want be able to sign out of my account.
+ As a user, I want be able to change my password.
+ As a user, I want be able to sign up if I don't already have an account.
+ As a user, I want be able to know who's turn it is.
+ As a user, I want to be able to only choose those locations that are unused.
+ As a user, I want to know if I have won, lost, or tied the game.
+ As a user, I want to be able to start a new game as soon as I finish

## Unsolved Problems

+ Would still like to add AI computer featured game-mode.
+ Multi user sign-in.

## Future Plan

Things that I want to consider implementing:
+ Adding a current session win count ticker for each player.
+ Multi-player / Multi-device gameplay.
+ Redesign of UI for themed purposes.
